The solution costs of 2 projects, the server and the client.

PlayersServerVS is the server in Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 IDE format; that is, it has the various files (such as the .sln file)
that has nothing to do with the application per se, but are required for Visual Studio.
PlayersServerWS is the server in Jetbrains WebStorm IDE format. It does not contain any files specific to the IDE; all files
are for the application.

The same *VS and *WS convention is used for the client projects.

If you are using the Visual Studio projects, first install the Node Tools for Visual Studio.
